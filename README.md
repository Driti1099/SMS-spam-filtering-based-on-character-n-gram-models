This Python code performs text classification using a Naive Bayes classifier on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.

1. Data Loading and Preparation:
   - The code imports necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
   - The SMS Spam Collection dataset is loaded from a CSV file using Pandas, where each SMS message is labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

2. Data Splitting:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets. 80% of spam and ham samples are randomly selected for training, and the remaining 20% are used for testing.

3. Feature Extraction:
   - Character n-grams (1 to 3 grams) are used as features for text representation.
   - The custom vocabulary includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols.
   - The CountVectorizer from scikit-learn is utilized to transform text data into numerical feature vectors.

4. Model Training:
   - A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained using the training data and the extracted features.
   - The Laplace smoothing parameter (alpha) is set to 1.0 by default.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - The trained classifier is used to make predictions on the test set.
   - Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are computed to assess the performance of the classifier.
   - The precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated separately for both the "spam" and "ham" classes, as well as their macro-averages.

6. Output:
   - The probabilities of features for each class (spam and ham) are printed.
   - The evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and macro-averages are printed to evaluate the classifier's performance.

Overall, this code demonstrates a simple approach to text classification using a Naive Bayes classifier with character n-gram features, which can effectively distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.
